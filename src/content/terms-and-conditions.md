<br />

### CONSENT TO FUTURE CONTACT

By providing your telephone number, you expressly authorized us to call you or send you recorded messages or texts about our products and services and to service your account, using automated technology to the telephone/cellular number you entered. You understand that you are not required to give such consent as a condition of any purchase. You consent and agree that your use of a key pad, mouse or other device to select an item, button, icon, checkbox, to enter text, or to perform a similar act/action, while using our Sites, for the purpose of accessing or making any transactions regarding any agreement, acknowledgment, consent, terms, disclosures or conditions, constitutes your signature, including without limitation of the United States Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, P.L. 106-229 (the "E-Sign Act") acceptance and agreement as if actually signed by you in writing.

<br />

### PLACING ORDERS

We have the right to refuse to accept any orders placed for Cialix products and services. Your order for products shall only be binding on us when you receive confirmation that a product has shipped. If we refuse your order, your money will be returned in full.

You are responsible for the accuracy of all information you provide that is necessary for us to process your order and/or ship your order to the correct location. If an order has not been shipped or shipped to an incorrect location due to such inaccuracy, you alone are responsible.

The provision of products and services is subject to availability. If products are out of stock, Cialix will inform you as soon as possible. You will be given the option of waiting until the products are in stock or of canceling your order.

If you have any problems or concerns regarding Leading Edge Health's products, you can reach us via the customer service contact information supplied on this website.

Dates for delivery are estimates only and are not guaranteed. Time is not of the essence in relation to such dates. They are also subject to any matter beyond our reasonable control.

If a delivery requires a signature to confirm receipt, it is your responsibility to ensure that there is someone at the delivery address to sign for acceptance of the products when delivered. It is also your responsibility to collect the products from any postal collection depot and/or arrange an alternative delivery date that you are available to sign for acceptance of the products.

Any products purchased are for personal use only. The products cannot be resold and cannot be given to any third party.

You hereby agree that any resale of goods you purchase from this site constitutes trademark and copyright infringement and is not protected under the “first-sale” doctrine because of the “material difference” and “quality controls” exceptions to the “first-sale” doctrine.

You further agree that resale by you makes you automatically liable for a $5,000.00 damages payment (five thousand U.S. Dollars) to Cialix, per occurence, which is enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. This is not intended as a penalty but rather as an estimation of harm that is difficult to gauge precisely (liquidated damages). There is equal bargaining power between us because this is not a product that you are obligated to purchase, and you are put on clear notice prior to purchasing the product.

We are not responsible for safe delivery of goods because we do not handle the direct delivery of your product. If the products are not delivered, arrive late, or are damaged in transit, you must make a claim with the carrier. We are happy to provide you with carrier contact details to place claims upon request.

Payment is due at the time you place your order.

We do not accept your order until we receive notice from our credit card merchant that your payment has been authorized and/or we have received payment in full in cleared funds.

If for any reason payment in full is not made, we may withhold or suspend delivery of the products.

<br />

### CREDIT CARD DESCRIPTOR

By placing an order with Cialix, you authorize us to charge your credit card in accordance with these terms and conditions. Cialix will place a one-time charge for the items selected by you and placed in your checkout cart on cialix.com. Please be aware that the descriptor (or subject line) that appears on your credit card charge entry will appear as cialix.com (888) 242-5491. If You have any questions about the charge or descriptor on your credit card statement, please contact our customer service department and they can assist you.

<br />

Any additional refund or return requests are considered solely at the discretion of the company.

### WARRANTIES, LIMITATION ON LIABILITY &amp; INDEMNIFICATION

Except as otherwise provided herein, our products and services are provided "as is" without any express or implied warranty of any kind, including warranties of merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose. Company liability hereunder shall in no event exceed an amount equal to the amount actually paid by you to Company in the month prior to a claim under this section, regardless of the basis for the claim. You understand that this is a significant limitation on your right to sue Company and you should not proceed if you do not agree. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Company, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against all claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of the use by you of the Sites, including claims by other users of your equipment, access, products or membership.

### DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER

PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR AND YOUR BUSINESS’ RIGHTS. EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE RIGHTS THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE LIMITED OR MAY NOT EXIST. YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS MAY ONLY BRING A CLAIM IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF (LEAD OR OTHERWISE) OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.

THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. HOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES) AND MUST FOLLOW THESE TERMS AS A COURT WOULD.

If you have a complaint, dispute, or controversy, you agree to first contact us at [support@Cialix.com](mailto:support@Cialix.com) to attempt to resolve the dispute or controversy informally. Any controversy or claim arising out of or related to the use of the Website, any product, service, or software, these Terms, the Privacy Policy, any affiliate agreement, or your relationship with us that cannot be resolved through such informal process or through negotiation within 120 days shall be resolved by binding, confidential arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. We agree that any claim we may have against you or your business will also be subject to this arbitration provision, except as provided in Sections 20 and 21 below. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator in the English language in St. Louis County, Missouri, unless we both agree to conduct the arbitration by telephone or written submissions. The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Procedures, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. The AAA’s Rules are available at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org) or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms and Conditions of Use and Sale, the Privacy Policy, this arbitration provision, and any other terms incorporated by reference into these Terms and Conditions of Use and Sale. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or Cialix.

Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s Rules. In all other respects, the parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.

The arbitrator shall follow the substantive law of the State of Idaho without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Any award rendered shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

You and Cialix agree that disputes will only be arbitrated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated, on a class wide, representative basis, or with any other arbitration(s) or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. You and Cialix expressly waive any right to pursue any class or other representative action against each other.

Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other claims except that all claims must be brought within 1 year after the claim arises (the 1 year period includes the 120-day informal resolution procedures described above).

This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.

This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with Cialix, bankruptcy, assignment, or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE, AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH BINDING, FINAL, AND CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION.

<br />

### SEVERABILITY

If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement, the Terms of Use, the Privacy Statement, or any portion thereof, to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remainder of the Agreement, the Terms of Use, and the Privacy Statement will continue in full force and effect.

<br />

### NO WAIVER

No waiver of or by Cialix shall be deemed a waiver of any subsequent default of the same provision of this Agreement. If any term, clause or provision hereof is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the validity or operation of any other term, clause or provision and such invalid term, clause or provision shall be deemed to be severed from this Agreement.

<br />

### HEADINGS

All headings are solely for the convenience of reference and shall not affect the meaning, construction, or effect of this Agreement.

<br />

### COMPLETE AGREEMENT

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to Your access and use of the Website and Your ordering and use of the Products, and supersedes and replaces all prior understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such subject matters.

<br />
